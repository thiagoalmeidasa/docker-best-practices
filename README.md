There are hundreds of useful tips around on how to use Docker. Unfortunately, the most useful bits of information are often buried in blog posts, talks or within long-winded documentation. I thought it might be useful to collect all these Docker tips and consolidate them in one place.

Please don't hesitate to submit a Pull Request to help the list grow!

## Docker images
### Minimizing layer size
Some installations create data that isn't needed. Try to remove this unnecessary data within layers:

```
RUN yum install -y epel-release && \
    rpmkeys --import file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7 && \
    yum install -y --setopt=tsflags=nodocs bind-utils gettext iproute\
    v8314 mongodb24-mongodb mongodb24 && \
    yum -y clean all
```

After install new packages, clean the cache folder:

```
apt-get autoclean && apt-get --purge -y autoremove && \
rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
```


For more detailed information, see [container best practices](http://docs.projectatomic.io/container-best-practices/#_clear_packaging_caches_and_temporary_package_downloads).

### Minimizing number of layers
Try to reduce the number of layers that will be created in your Dockerfile. Most Dockerfile instructions will add a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. 

For more detailed information see [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#minimize-the-number-of-layers).

### Tagging
Use tags to reference specific versions of your image.

Tags could be used to denote a specific Docker container image. Hence, the tagging strategy must include a unique counter like `build id` from a CI server (e.g. Jenkins) to help with identifying the right correct image. 

For more detailed information see [The tag command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/).


### Log Rotation
Use `--log-opt` to allow log rotation. This helps if the containers you are creating are too verbose and are created too often due to a continuous deployment process.

For more detailed information, see [the log driver options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/#/json-file-options).


## Docker container
### Containers should be disposable/ephemeral
The creation and startup time of a container should be as small as possible. Furthermore, a container should shut down gracefully when a `SIGTERM` is received. This makes it easier to scale up or down. It also makes it easier to remove unhealthy containers and to spawn new ones.

For more detailed information, see [The Tweleve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/disposability) and [best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#containers-should-be-ephemeral).

### Containers should have its PID1 to be a Zombie reaper
Container processes may not respond to an immediate command of `docker stop`. If our main process is determined by our command or execution to be in the `entrypoint` and is uncapable to manage Reaping, our `docker stop` won't work. This is because no `SIGINT` would be able to reach the appropriate process. We should, whenever possible, use container images that extend Reaping management.

So, the question is: does the process you execute in your entrypoint register signal handlers? A good way to figure this out might be to check whether your process responds properly to `docker stop` (or if it waits for ten seconds before exiting). In this case, tools like [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) can help fix this problem.

### One container, One responsibility, One process
If a container only has one responsibility (which should in almost all cases involve one process), it makes it much easier to scale horizontally or reuse the container in general.

[Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#run-only-one-process-per-container).

### Store share data in volumes
If services need to share data, use shared volumes. Make sure that services are designed for concurrent data access (read and write).

For more detailed information see [Manage data in containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/).

### Use variables, not files
When possible, use environment variables instead of conf files. It will make your
container more secure and easier to migrate.

## Docker registry
### Garbage collection
Remove unnecessary layers in your registry. For more detailed information see [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/registry/garbage-collection.md).

## Docker security
### Limit access from network
Only open ports which are needed in production; containers should only be accessible by other containers that need them. Groups of containers should use their own sub-network.

```
$ docker network create --driver bridge isolated_nw
$ docker run --network=isolated_nw --name=container busybox
```

### You can't trust anyone
> This may seem like a harsh thing to say, but in a climate where even baby monitors and light-bulbs can be taken over to participate in DDoS attacks, we need to get smart.

#### Don't use an image unless it's official
There are no official images for ARM at this time, but `resin/rpi-raspbian` is used by thousands of devices and curated by resin.io. You can use it as your base image.

#### Don't run any binaries you that didn't compile yourself
It's way better to compile your own binaries than relying on tar.gz files provided by someone you know nothing about.

> Docker Security by Adrian Mouat coins the term "poison image" for an image tainted with malware.

If you want to create a Docker image for software such as Prometheus.io, Node.js or Golang, head over to their download page and locate the official binary package, then add it into one of the base images we covered above.

If no binary exists, take the time to rebuild it from source and don't take any risks. Google search the build instructions if you run into issues; they can often be found quickly.

Docker Captain Alex Ellis has provided a set of Dockerfiles for ARM on Github for common software such as Node.js, Python, Consul and Nginx: [alexellis/docker-arm](http:s//github.com/alexellis/docker-arm)

For more detailed information see [5 things about Docker on Raspberry Pi](http://blog.alexellis.io/5-things-docker-rpi/) by Docker Captain Alex Ellis @alexellisuk.

### Limit access to filesystem
Start your container in a read-only mode with `--read-only`. You should also do this with volumnes by adding `:ro`. This makes it harder for attackers to corrupt your container.

```
$ docker run --read-only ...
$ docker run -v /my/data:/data:ro ...
```

### Limit memory
You should limit the memory resources of your container against DoS attacks or/and against applications with memory leaks. This protects your host system and other containers. You should use `-m` and `--memory-swap` to limit memory.

```
$ docker run -m 128m --memory-swap 128m ...
```

### Vulnerability scanning
Use a security scanner for your images; this comprises a static analysis of software-level vulnerabilities.

For more detailed information see [Docker Security Scanning](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/image-scan/) or [Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair).

### Switch to non-root-user
If your service does not need root privileges, **do not use root**! Consider the **Principle of Least Privilege** applied to Docker containers. Create a new user and switch the user with `USER`.

```
RUN groupadd -r myapp && useradd -r -g myapp myapp
USER myapp
```

For more detailed information see [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#user).

## Application running within docker
### Logging to stdout
To handle logs in your service easily, write all your logs to `stdout`. This uniform process makes it easy for the docker daemon to grab this stream.

For more detailed information see [The Tweleve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/logs) and [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/).
